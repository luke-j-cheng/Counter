<h1> 🏀 Basketball Scorekeeper 🏀</h1>
<h3>Made using Verilog in AMD Xilinix Vivado
<br/> FPGA Board: Basys 3 (Digilent)</h3>

<b> Welcome to the repository for my first ever project!
<br/> I wanted to do a FPGA/verilog project revolving about something that interests me, so I decided to make a basketball scorekeeper!

<h2> How The Board Works </h2>
<b>
 - There are three switches, which when toggled on, dictate whether to increment the counter by 1, 2, or 3 points.
<br/> - By pressing the board's center button, the counter adds the specified number of points.
<br/> - When all switches are on, and the center button is pressed, the score is then decremented by 1.
<br/> - The top button will also reset the score to 0 when pressed (under any circumstance).
